  abstract = {Blockchain and machine learning establish a new age of smart automation in the ever-changing area of automation. The Intelligent Process Automation Framework (IPAF) combines blockchain and machine learning with RPA. Three primary IPAF applications handle distinct RPA aspects. Blockchain-Enhanced Data Security (BEDS) is an excellent alternative to RPA since it protects data. The AML algorithm's self-learning, changing, and decision-making capabilities make RPA bots more versatile. Decentralized autonomous automation (DAA) transforms human behaviour. RPA becomes transparent and autonomous. IPAF is superior to other RPA techniques because it reviews outcomes thoroughly. BEDS improves data security and privacy, while AML simplifies scaling, moving, and changing. The DAA renders open judgments. IPAF is great for firms that desire sophisticated automation since it performs well across these metrics. The research reveals that blockchain and machine learning technologies changed RPA. It also illustrates how IPAF improves automation in several areas.},
